        Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the American technology conglomerate Meta.
        Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin,
        Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given
        to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to
        other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in
        the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is 14 years.[6] As of December 2023, Facebook
        claimed almost 3.07 billion monthly active users worldwide.[7] As of November 2024, Facebook ranked as the
        third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8] It was the
        most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[9]

    <p> Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and
        smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing personal information about themselves. They
        can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their friend
        or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with
        Messenger, edit messages (within 15 minutes after sending),[10][11] join common-interest groups, and receive
        notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.

        > Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica
        data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance.[12] The company
        has also been subject to criticism over its psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and
        over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[13] Commentators
        have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number
        of users to appeal to advertisers.[14]
